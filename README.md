Odd and Even Game

This game was developed using Java. It uses OOP principles, exceptions and two design patterns, Factory and Strategy.
In this game, a human plays against the CPU. The human selects the difficulty and whether they're odd or even and then decides the number of fingers to output. After each round, the winner is declared, and the overall results are shown when the game ends. For the difficulty, different strategies are set in place. Level Easy randomly picks the number of fingers (off a base seed). Medium uses the random strategy for 3 rounds before checking the human's track record for #odd and #even fingers shown to make an informed guess as to what they will pick this round. Hard switches between strategies after losing a round.
